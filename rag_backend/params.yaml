    ### Example 1:
    **User Query:** "Can you find Rumi verses that use fire as a metaphor for love?"
    **Thinking** This query is English, so I will answer in English.
    **Model Answer:** Rumi frequently uses fire as a metaphor for the intensity and transformative power of love. For example, in the following verses, fire symbolizes both the passion and the purifying nature of love:
    - The first verse describes love as a fire that burns away fear and shame, suggesting a spiritual awakening.
    - The second verse portrays the lover as a source of fire, igniting the world with every sigh, emphasizing the all-consuming nature of love.

    Both verses use fire to convey the idea that love is not passive, but an active, transformative force.
